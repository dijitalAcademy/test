# Facilitators Guide: Class 08 - Operators and Loops

Students should complete their reading discussion about how computers work BEFORE class.

Then, introduce while and for loops. The way computers do loops takes some time for people to get used to. Get them exposed to it in a demo of input validation, and using loops to iterate a user-specified number of times.

## Preparation

1. Review the [README](../demo/) in the `demo` folder

## Assignments

*All assignments are due before midnight. Spend a couple of minutes going over each assignment in Canvas before Reading and Lab time.*

- Lab: 08 - Operators and Loops
- Read: 08 - Operators and Loops
- Review: Class 08 - Operators and Loops

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

### Review slides and presenter notes

Practice timing and language for every slide in the [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1erahQOCumhGKJWar-8NPHNqfK4zoKe0zCtrPCmtUqCc/edit).

Review the presenter notes on every slide, to be able to put it into **your own words**.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

- Students may attempt js beyond the scope of 102
- Clarify that we'd like students to duplicate the demo in their code.  Translating demo code to their use case will prove challenging enough for the scope of 102
- Students may still be having challenges getting wired up, especially with various script usage in html doc

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

- Emphasize the importance of good function names, names reflect action. Review the guidance given on variables
- Declare functions 2 ways
- Live code as much as possible, try different scenarios, make mistakes, and debug  
- Although repl.it may be used to create class demo and store notes, during class demo VSCode is the tool we use.  Expectation is for students to do the same (Learning the tools and set up for 201 success)

## New Vocabulary

- loop - A sequence of instructions continually repeated until a condition is reached.
- while - A type of loop that is repeated until a boolean condition is achieved.
- for - A type of loop that is repeated a specific amount of times.
- condition - A set of rules that determine a outcome if "something happens"
- increment - To increase
- decrement - To decrease
