# Facilitators Guide: Class 05 - Design web pages with CSS

CSS recap and focus on Color.

In-class demo should split screen between VSCode and Chrome to display VSCode Live Server extension.  Once again, class will guide you through the demo, with instructor guided focus on flow of page, block vs inline-block elements, and special attention to CSS file layout / syntax.

## Preparation

1. Review the Reading, the lab, the quiz, and the demo. Be ready to run the slide deck, which has few slides and mostly acts as a placeholder for class discussions.

## Assignments

*All assignments are due before midnight. Spend a couple of minutes going over each assignment in Canvas before Reading and Lab time.*

- Lab: 05 - Design web pages with CSS
- Read: 05 - Design web pages with CSS
- Review: Class 05 - Design web pages with CSS

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

### Review slides and presenter notes

Practice timing and language for every slide in the [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fqRciBUntW3-TPtmoat7zIe7v5sXNJI8I0rXmNz19-o/edit).

Review the presenter notes on every slide, to be able to put it into **your own words**.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

- Students might struggle to get their external CSS files connected to their HTML file
- When students are shown floats, breakage happens.  Embrace the debugging opportunities
- Students will try to spend a significant amount of time on CSS.  Encourage a minimal MVP and encourage to revisit at a later time

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

- Split screen with VSCode and Chrome to display VSCode Live Server extension
- Use the same class-mobbed HTML file
- Explain User expectations:  logical layout, clickable links are underlined or on "buttons", others?  Get student input
- Goal:  achieve the same minimal MVP that you expect from students while touching base on common problem points:  page flow, color, font
- CSS page flow opportunities:
  - header:
    - center h1
    - float nav to upper right
    - display list items as inline-block for horizontal list
  - main:
    - change article width, display 3 articles in-line
  - footer:
    - copyright moved to bottom center
    - vertical sitemap with links
- Show basic Color and Font manipulation of  page, class and individual elements
