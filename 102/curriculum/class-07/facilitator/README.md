# Facilitators Guide: Class 07 - Programming with JavaScript

Students will think about programming at a higher level: as a sequence of steps. This works great with the concept of functions, because of how functions encapsulate a set of steps to get something done.

You'll run a fun in-class exercise to emphasize just how exactly a computer will do what its told. Having struggled with making a little JS work, students will likely relate to the precision needed in communicating with the computer to teach it new things.

Each new task the computer learns can get a name. This makes it like a 'function' that be performed on demand.

## Preparation

1. Review the learning objectives, reading, demo, and lab.
1. To execute example JS in VSCode, install:
    - <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner>
1. Bring a sweatshirt or coat to use for illustrating the importance of writing good steps.
1. Ensure you have working example code, built up from the previous days, that you can refactor with functions.

## Assignments

*All assignments are due before midnight. Spend a couple of minutes going over each assignment in Canvas before Reading and Lab time.*

- Lab: 07 - Programming with JS
- Read: 07 - Programming with JS
- Review: Class 07 - Programming with JS

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

### Review slides and presenter notes

Practice timing and language for every slide in the [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ClRYKjhLcmJjEBkRT5ZA0Yj7kuc0Ci-zfCYhL5BVZPA/edit).

Review the presenter notes on every slide, to be able to put it into **your own words**.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

- Students may attempt js beyond the scope of 102
- Clarify that we'd like students to duplicate the demo in their code.  Translating demo code to their use case will prove challenging enough for the scope of 102
- Students may still be having challenges getting wired up, especially with various script usage in html doc

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

- Emphasize the importance of good function names, names reflect action. Review the guidance given on variables
- Declare functions 2 ways
- Live code as much as possible, try different scenarios, make mistakes, and debug
- Although repl.it may be used to create class demo and store notes, during class demo VSCode is the tool we use.  Expectation is for students to do the same (Learning the tools and set up for 201 success)

## New Vocabulary

- Script - Used to define a client side script, or reference to JavaScript code that will execute.
- Programmatic problem solving - An approach to problem solving where you schedule or plan, step by step, the approach to your problem.
- Expression - Any code that is evaluated and resolves to a value.
- Operator - =, &&, || are examples of operators.
- Function
  - Declaration - Defines a function.  Can take in parameters.
  - Call - Passes control (and sometimes arguments) to a function.  Also referred to as invoking.
  - Parameters - A set of variables that a function expects to use while executing the code inside the function.  These are locally scoped and only available within the function.
  - Arguments - A set of variables passed when calling a function (that the function is expecting) to be used within the function.
  - Return value - A value that is sent out of a function to be used outside of the function code.
- Refactoring - The act of changing code to meet other standards, make more readable, or to make more efficient.
