# Code 301 Preview and Project Week Kickoff

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Overview

Today is the last day of classroom instruction for this course. There should be a little bit of review, but keep it minimal. It’s often fun to look back at a couple of their Week 1 projects to show the students how far they’ve come in the past few weeks.

The focus of today should be more on the future, including the immediate future of Project Week, as well as the long-term future of the students’ progression into other courses. It’s common to have a discussion on this day about the differences between the various paths offered by your school at the 401 level, and maybe solicit a guest lecture from a Code 301 instructor.

From the perspective of preparing students who are advancing to Code 301, especially those starting that course very soon, it is helpful to give them some pointers on how to get ready.

In addition, it is useful on this day to bring up the webpage with the description of Code 301, go through and give an overview of each topic, and allow students to ask as many questions as they have. This is typically one of the least-planned course days, but one that students consistently cite on their surveys as being one of their favorites.

During class time you need to discuss with students how to approach the 301 entrance exam. Students may take the exam at the time of their choosing at any time between the end of lecture 15 and the beginning of class 15. This typically falls over a weekend. Students may utilize as much time as necessary during that time block, generally students complete it in under 3 hours. The exam is open note, and they are encouraged to write and run code to figure out the answers. Tell students directly that they may not collaborate with others who are currently taking the test or have done so in the past (e.g.: online test answers).

## Preparation

1. Make sure all project teams have been created and communicated to your class.
1. Upload the `project-guidelines.md` file to the daily class repo.

## Lecture

1. Code Review
1. Preview of 301 Topics
   - Open the schools website and talk through the learning objectives.
1. Go over 301 entrance exam guidlines.
1. Final Project Overview
   - Go over the final project description/assignments.
   - Discuss GitHub workflow in teams.
   - Specify that GitHub Projects is the planning tool they should use.

## Lab Notes

This lab activity should be completed as a project group. It is an exercise in dealing with potential merge conflicts. It should take approximately an hour to complete. Other than that, the rest of the day should be devoted to project planning.

## General Comments

As for Project Week preparation, by the end of class today students should be assembled into teams, have their project descriptions to work from, have reviewed the final project Canvas assignment in class, and have been instructed on how to manage team projects.
