## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

In this class, we introduce Career Coaching at a high level, and get students started on the preparation of their materials.

Students will read the Career Coaching Overview first. Then they will go through the LinkedIn setup tutorial and the resume prep and submission process. Submission will be two links: one to their resume and one to their LinkedIn profile.

Students will likely have completed resumes following different formats. Students must use the resume link shared with them in prework, using the given template, for Career Accelerator Program use. This creates a consistent experience for partners when accessing the resume pool and helps students get those jobs!

To make the Career Coaching Overview more relatable, consider sharing your own career success stories or stories of student success. Students face a difficult journey and will find it helpful to have relatable goals.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

Students must use the resume shared with them in an automation email.  If they already have a resume, they can migrate information from their existing resume easily.

Students must submit their resume by linking it to their Canvas profile, following the instructions in the Resume portion of the lab.

An example of what a tech interview process looks like may also be helpful.

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

Students will likely want to spend more time than necessary on these tasks.  Very important to manage the scope and offer guidance to avoid mismanaged time.  30 - 45 minutes is a maximum recommendation for reading the Career Coaching Overview, LinkedIn setup, and resume review and submission.  Remember, these initial setup tasks are high level, as they will dial in more in the weeks to come.

_Set and discuss the expectation they will be assigned pre-work moving into 201 (in Canvas) that they've already completed here in 102. For a few reasons:_

- Time between classes (re-acquainted with Canvas and/or refresher on previously submitted work)
- Practice makes perfect (back to growth mindset)
- Should make for very quick completion if already done

_e.g., submitting "I already did this" is not an acceptable submission._
