# Facilitators Guide: Class 03 - Revisions and the Cloud

Class 3 introduces students to git, GitHub, and git-flow.

This is a little more slide-heavy than other classes. Students can follow along with the slides to make a repo, clone it, edit a file, and push it back up to see it deployed.

After you run the slides, recap the process by demoing it on your own machine.

Students will then complete the lab (cloning their reading-notes), and then the reading assignment (adding a page to their LJ with notes on git).

## Preparation

1. Review the [README](../demo/) in the `demo` folder

## Assignments

*All assignments are due before midnight. Spend a couple of minutes going over each assignment in Canvas before Reading and Lab time.*

- Lab: 03 - Revisions and the Cloud
- Read: 03 - Revisions and the Cloud
- Review: Class 03 - Revisions and the Cloud

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

### Review slides and presenter notes

Practice timing and language for every slide in the [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o-pJT27mq-eBdaVTiQmcanrLY3MNf0O-7GzNQJkwcuU/edit).

Review the presenter notes on every slide, to be able to put it into **your own words**.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

Coming soon.  Please add your notes.

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

- Windows
  - If `root` owns `.profile`, git won't work.
- Reinforce git vs github.
  - git is the 'sport', and GitHub is the 'public arena'
- TODO may look something like this:  
  - Set up `reading-notes` repo with students during demo.
  - Create `git-github-notes.md` locally, make a change, and ACP

- Reading may be a deeper dive than necessary, but information may be valuable for reference.  For example, setup is already done and `git init` is not necessary if creating a repo as instructed.  Perhaps encourage an external link to reading in the markdown file

## New Vocabulary

- VCS - Version Control System, or the tracking of different versions of software
- Git vs. Github
  - Git is a distributed version control too that manages a projects source code history. Git is installed locally on a computer.
  - GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running a Git tool.
- local vs remote
  - Local refers to your computer
  - Remote refers to somewhere outside of your computer (usually in the cloud)
- clone -- A git command to copy or replicate a repository to your local computer.  This also creates a connection that allows you to send potential updates.
- commit - Taking changes completed locally on your computer and preparing them to be stored in a remote location.
- ACP - short for (A)dd. (C)ommit, (P)ush.
- deployment - As it refers to web development, this is deploying your site so it is live on the internet and can be viewed by others.
