# Facilitators Guide: State and Props

## Overview

Today we dive into two important topics: state and props. These will form the foundataion of understanding React, so spend time on these complex ideas. We also cover React-Bootstrap for styling. Be sure to talk about all the different options that the docs offer for the components that you demo.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Practice [the demo](../demo/)
- Be familiar with Netlify so you can walk students though the deployment process
- Have a React application ready to deply as a demonstration in your GitHub account

## Lecture Outline

One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

## What changed from the previous class?

- In the last class we introduced components and passing static values from one parent component to a child component. This class we are introducing state and passing dynamic values from the parent component into the child component.

## What might students struggle with today?

- The ansynchronous nature of updating state
- Deploying their application to Netlify

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...

## General Comments and Notes

- Spend a few minutes talking about the WRRC as it relates to the gallery of horns
- Students will struggle customizing react-Bootstap styling.  Explain how Bootstrap uses HTML class names to impact style and show them the bootstrap cheatsheet and bootstrap shuffle docs to help relieve pain points.  See [DISCUSSION.md](../DISCUSSION.md) bookmark recommendations for Bootstrap cheatsheet and shuffle
