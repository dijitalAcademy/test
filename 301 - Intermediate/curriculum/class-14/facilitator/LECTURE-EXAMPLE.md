There will be tests that they can run so they will know if they have completed the tasks correctly. They will need to deploy both their front-end and back-end.
  - Demonstrate how to unzip the assessment and run tests in the terminal. Do not show any code from the assesment.
- How long do they have?
  - 4 hours
- What resources can they use?
  - Anything expect other people, remind them of our policy on plagerism.
- What if they fail? 
  - There will be an option for one retake

### Exam Administration

- Review the rubric with the students. They should be mostly able to determine if they have passed the exam or not based off of the rubric.
- It may be helpful to have them unzip their assesments as a group with you present so that if they have issues you are able to help them.
- Make sure they understand that when the assesment starts they will only be able to recieve help with issues related to git or running the assesment on their machine.
