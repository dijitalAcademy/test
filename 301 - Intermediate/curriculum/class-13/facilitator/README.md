# Facilitators Guide: Updating a Resource

## DEI Reminder

In our next class we will discuss Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.  Be sure to remind and encourage students to complete [the reading assignment](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-14/DISCUSSION) before class begins in order to acheive full credit for the activity.

## Overview

Today you will finish up your CRUD discussion with the UPDATE route. Point out that while you are NOT going to be demonstrating how to connect a cloud-based MongoDB instance to a deployed application, they will be expected to do this during project week. The README.md for today has step-by-step instructions for how to do this, but the goal is for them to teach themselves how to do something hard.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Practice today's [Demo](../demo)

## Lecture Outline

One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk**

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

### CRUD - UPDATE

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Everything changes and applications need to be able to adjust their data to accommodate those changes.
  - `UPDATE` is an essiential part of a CRUD application

- **What** (10 min)
  - The ability for a user to update a record in an application. In Our Best Books Application, we will be writing an update route to update the information on the books.

- **How** (30 min)
  - Draw out the WRRC. By now, this should be familiar to the students. Introduce the concept of a PUT route.
  - Go through the [DEMO](../demo)
  - Given time, demonstrate connecting cloud based MongoDB (Atlas) to a deployed application
    - When configuring your Atlas cluster, you'll need to ensure that the cluster is completely "open" (*) to allow access.

## Lab Notes

The lab instructions are intentionally left vague and short to encourage students to find their own solution to the problem domain. It might be worth talking different ways of solving problems during code review and lecture time to encourage this thinking.

We are purposely not teaching the students how to connect MongoDB to their deployed application. This is a challenge for them to figure out during project week. We are, however, pointing them in the right direction. In the README.md for today, there is a step-by-step guide for setting up a MongoDB Atlas account that you can use to make that connection Point this out to them. Make sure they understand that most of what they do when they graduate will be to learn on their own and figure things out so this is a nudge in that direction. Our intention is not to abandon them but to provide them with an opportunity to practice this skill in an environment where we can support them.

## What changed from the previous class

We are adding a PUT route to the application.

## What might students struggle with today

Students will most likely be stressed about their final tomorrow. Plan to spend some time answering questions about the test.

## Past bugs, issues or surprises
