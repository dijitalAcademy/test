# Solution: Advanced Topics

Refer to the official [City Explorer React App](../../city-explorer-app/front-end) and [City Explorer Proxy Server](../../city-explorer-app/back-end) as a reference for grading.

## Lab Requirements

- Completed City Explorer Back-End with all APIs integrated, modularized
- Server API calls cached from in-memory object
- Quality refactoring attempt

### Grading Standards & Notes

- Deployment
  - Live (Deployed) URLs for both the React front-end and Node back-end are required for full points.
    - Partial credit available for obvious/reasonable effort even if deployment is non-working
  - Use the student supplied deployed URL to validate their code against the official City Explorer application functionality
- Features / Code Standards
  - Quality attempt at refactoring and modularizing the server code
  - Server must have 404 and 500 error handlers, client displays error messages
  - Route definitions and handlers should be separated
  - Back-end API data (weather, movies, yelp) must come from in-memory Cache when available
  - Location data must be retrieved from live API client side

#### Lab Assistance Notes

Students must explore some level of refactoring today. While it's a clean up day for the whole City Explorer back end, refactoring and thinking wide is a key takeaway.

Make sure the students are going down roads, specifically sane ones.
