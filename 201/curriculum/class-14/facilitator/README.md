# Advanced JS Topics and CSS Animations

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Overview

Today we will introduce re-instantiation. This is challenging material for the students to even grasp the architecture of the demo, much less implement it on their own. Be sure to point out that this is something they will be expected to implement on their final projects as well.

Depending on the skill level of the cohort, you may choose to spend the remainder of the time discussing advanced JS topics and/or CSS animations. Refer to the main daily class README for advanced JS topics.

## Preparation

1. Add the starter code for todays lab to the class repo.
1. Skim the daily readings and be prepared if students have questions.
1. Review the code demos and be sure to understand how to construct them within lecture. Review the respective markdown file for each demo.
1. Work with your principal instructor directly to conduct the [Psychological Safety talk](./PSYCH_SAFETY). This discussion should last about an hour at the beginning of the course.
1. Have groups created for project week and share them with the students. Refer to the [Projects doc](PROJECTS).
1. Upload `css-animations.md` file is uploaded to the daily class repo.
1. Create and post paired-programming parters for the day's lab.

## Lab Notes

This lab needs to be properly presented to students. It is a very difficult lab that employs 301 and 401 level object oriented skills and planning. They are expected to attempt it to build their problem solving skills but are not expected to complete it. Setting it up as a challenge to measure against will help to make it less scary of a lab.

This lab is another stand-alone lab. This is a tricky timed lab, with provided starter code; groups are not allowed to change the HTML. Students will have 4 hours to work on the lab. It can help to create the pairs from the project groups to catch any potential conflicts, then post the project groups later in the afternoon so adjustments can be made, if needed.

The assignment is to create a shopping cart for the Odd Duck Products website. Students may struggle with linking between the two HTML pages, event handlers for adding or deleting an item from the shopping cart, or capturing user input from the fields. This is a good exercise to reinforce local storage, as persistence is a requirement of the final projects.
