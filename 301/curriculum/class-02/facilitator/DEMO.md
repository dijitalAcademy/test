# DEMO: State, Props, and Bootstrap

The demo folder contain only React components.

1) Use `create-react-app` to intialize a project titled `beast-state`.
1) Install the following third party dependencies:
   - `react-bootstrap`

1) Build each component from the `components` folder in front of the students, showcasing individual component state values, and deligated component props.
1) Be sure to cover importing json files from your project directory using an `import` statement.  Briefly discuss how webpack can load a 'json' file and make it accessible from our React code.
1) Note any **ternary** statements used for conditional assignment.
   - Please refrain from using ternary statements for conditional rendering.
1) Import each component into `App.js` and render each in the return statement.
