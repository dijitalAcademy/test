# Facilitators Guide:

## Overview

Today is a lighter day for new concepts. Students will have a DEI workshop followed by preparation and administration of their final exam.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Schedule a presenter for the DEI workshop or be familiar with the [materials for the presentation](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/facilitator/diversity-equity-inclusion-presentation).
- Download the assessment.zip to your local machine so that you can show the students how to open it and run tests.

## Lecture Outline

One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### Career Review

- Get a show of hands to see how many students reached out to PPH speaker
- Lead a discussion on networking and meet-ups

### Warm-Up

- **Student Analysis** (5 min)
  - Show or print the [warm-up code](../warm-up/warm-up.md)
- **Debrief** (5-10 min)
  - Refer to the [Warmup Notes](../warm-up/NOTES.md)
  - Optionally demo the running code at Repl.it

### Shred Talk

- **Why**
  - Daily "Shred Talks" introduce the student to a new javascript coding concept, setting them up to complete the daily "Code Challenge" series
- **What**
  - Refer to the [challenge documentation](../challenges/README.md)
- **How** (10 min)
  - Follow the [Demo Code](../challenges/DEMO.md)
- **Note**
  - If you are short on time, this can be omitted from class lecture. There are official videos that students can watch in lieu of you leading this portion of class.

### Code Review

- Today should be a smaller day for code review if you do any at all.
- Get students to talk about their process for debugging the starter code.
- Pull up the code from a student who is still struggling with the starter code and have the class work through the bugs with them.

### Exam Prep

- Demonstrate how the students should unzip their assessment file. Windows users may need to move the assessment to the Linux side of their machine.
- Demonstrate how to run tests. Make sure not to show any code from the exam, only how to use their terminal to run the test command.

### Exam Administration

- Present students with the grading rubric from the readme within the assessment.
- Answer any questions pertaining to the rubric.
- Instruct the students to submit their exam within 4 hours of the start time.

Students spend the lab time of Class 14 taking the exam.

Follow the [Facilitator instructions in the exam folder](/facilitator/final-exam/FACILITATOR.md) to administer the exam.
